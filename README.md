# YouTube-Frontend-Comparison
A comparison of Open Source YouTube Frontends

I've found that while many open source frontends for 
watching YouTube 
privately exist, there's no central source that allows 
users to compare these projects, and otherwise requires 
a user to test which project suits them best by testing 
each project one at a time. This project aims to 
streamline the process of picking a private way to watch
YouTube.
