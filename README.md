# Why I created this project

I've found that while many open source projects exist for watching YouTube privately, there was no central way that would allow a user to compare these projects, and otherwise required a user to find out which project suited them best by testing each individually. So this repository aims to streamline the process of picking a frontend to watch YouTube.
